## Features

### Live Update
![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/3](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/3)

The web dashboard autosaves your changes and updates badges without changing the URL. That means once the badge is committed, you have full manual control of content and no more commits need to be made. This README uses Maintained badges to update development status! Clearly communicated up-front without any commit spam.

### Dynamic Value Sources
![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/4](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/4)

Use the powerful built-in syntax to dynamically pull data anywhere from the web in a variety of formats including plaintext, JSON, and with regular expressions. More formats may be considered.

### Super Stylish Styles
![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/6](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/6)

Badges are all about style, and we're adding many! The badge above shows what styles we have so far. Each style supports a variety of colors for maximum style points. Got style suggestions? Pull requests are welcome!

### Link Resources
![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/7](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/7)

Badges often link to repository resources - documentation, CI services, download links, and more. Why not centralize that with a hub page for all your linked badges?

### GitHub OAuth
![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/5](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/5)
